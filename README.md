# # Skip Woke Movie Player
Automatically skip woke scenes out of your movies!

Movies are magical. 
But people who control everything know that. 

That’s why most mainstream movies come stuffed with propaganda. 
Good values are shown as boring and bad values are shown as cool. 

While we may know which is which our families especially kids don’t know it. 
They get influenced by what they see. 

That’s why I am making ‘Skip Woke Movie Player’. 
A simple but effective way to enjoy movies and tv shows without propaganda.



**How to use it?**

It currently only works with movie video files. Netflix and Apple TV kind of devices will be supported later. 
If you watch movies with VLC or some other media player, you can use SWMP.

Step 1. Get the movie file. eg. No-Time-to-Die.mp4

Step 2. Get the corresponding .swmp file for that movie. eg. No-Time-to-Die.swmp

Step 3. Play the movie with Skip Woke Movie Player!

All annoying scenes with woke agenda will automatically be skipped by the player.


**What is .swmp file?**

.swmp stands for Skip Woke Movie Player. It is similar to .srt file which are used to show subtitle for movies.

Here's an example of how a .swmp file might look like:
```
1
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
unnecessary political comment
2
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:09,570
unrealistic girl power scene
3
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,173
inappropriate same-sex kissing scene
```

Basically the format to specify which scene to skip is like this:
- Enter the beginning and ending timecode, using the following format: **hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds –> hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds**
- You can enter a comment below the timecode to explain why that scene was skipped.


**Where do I find .swmp files?**

I will need your help for this. Hollywood has money but we have *people power*!
You can create and share .swmp files for your movies. You can share them freely with family and friends.
You can also mail me your files at skipwokevideoplayer@proton.me and I will add them on this page.

Skip Woke will always be a free and open source project. This project doesn't belong to any company, rather it belongs to all of us who want to watch movies without hollywood propaganda!



**Timeline**

I am currently working on the player and expect to release it in the next few weeks. I will later add a link to a newsletter where you can subscribe for updates.

If you are a developer and want to work on this project, let me know.
